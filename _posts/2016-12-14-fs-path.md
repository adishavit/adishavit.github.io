A short stroll along `filesystem::path`.

![](../../assets/path_1.jpg)

The "`experimental`" Filesystem TS has been with us for a few years living in the `std::experiment` namespace. With C++17 it [will finally](https://botondballo.wordpress.com/2016/11/25/trip-report-c-standards-meeting-in-issaquah-november-2016/) be merged into `std`.

This short post is not intended to be a full introduction to `filesystem` nor does it attempt to be exhaustive. It only examines some important methods of [`std::filesystem::path`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/fs/path).  
I write this mostly as a future quick reference for myself, with the hope that it may be helpful to others as well.

### Path Pebbles

`std::filesystem::path` provides several methods for decomposing a path into tokens.  

> *Objects of type `path` represent paths on a filesystem. Only **syntactic** aspects of paths are handled: the pathname may represent a non-existing path or even one that is not allowed to exist on the current file system or OS.*

Given a `path` created from the string `C:\folder\number\1\abc.123.txt`, it can be decomposed as follows:  
![](../../assets/path_breakdown_1.png)
A few things to note:

- `ext()` returns the last token following the **last** `.`;  
- `ext()` **includes** the last `.`;
- `stem()` returns everything from the *last* folder separator (e.g. `\`) up to the *last* `.`
- `stem()` does **not include** neither the `\` nor the `.`
- `parent_path()` does **not include** the last folder separator.

`std::filesystem::path` also provides several methods for extracting root-info of absolute paths:

Interestingly, if our initial `path` is set to `C:\folder\number\1\abc.123.txt\` (with a trailing `\`) the `path` is assumed to be a folder name and the results are different:
![](../../assets/path_breakdown_3.png)
In this case:

- `filename()` is set to `.`, the special "file" name designating the folder itself;
- `ext()` is empty;
- `stem()` is set to `.`

This might seem inconsistent since suddenly `stem()` includes the `.` and `ext()` doesn't, but in this case the *dot* is the special folder file-name, not a character within the file-name designating the beginning of the file extension.  
This approach also (trivially) maintains the invariant that `filename() == stem() + ext()` (this is actually pseudo-code since there is no `path::operator+()` - see below).

### Building Paths

We can build up paths with folder separators using the (IMO cleverly named) `/` operator:

```cpp
namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;

fs::path p("folder");cout << p / "foo.txt" << '\n';p /= "bar.txt";cout << p << '\n';             ```
Which gives:

```
folder\foo.txtfolder\bar.txt	
```

We can also concatenate `path`s *without* the folder separator using the `+=` operator:

```cpp
fs::path p("folder");p += "_foo";cout << p << '\n';             p += "/bar.txt"; // string includes a /cout << p << '\n';   ```
Which gives:

```
folder_foofolder_foo/bar.txt
```
If the concatenated string contains folder separators they will be treated properly: 

```cpp
cout << p               << '\n';         cout << p.filename()    << '\n';         cout << p.parent_path() << '\n';      ```
Produces:

```
folder_foo/bar.txtbar.txtfolder_foo
```
as expected.

Strangely, unlike the `operator/`, there is no non-mutating `operator+`.  
This might be due to the fact that `path`s are convertible to strings which *do* support such an operator.

### More Quirks

#### Single char literals 
At least on the implementation I tested, all the `path` API calls that accept *only* other `path` arguments work with strings, but do not work with single character literals:

```cpp
fs::path p;// p /= 'x';  // ERROR// p /  'x';  // ERROR// p != '.';  // ERRORp += 'x';     // OK! operator+=() accepts string types toop /= "x";p /  "x";p != ".";p += "x";```

#### remove_filename()
As seen in the figure above, although `filename()` does *not* include the leading `\`, [`remove_filename()`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/fs/path/remove_filename) does remove it:

```cpp
fs::path path("folder/foo.bar");  cout << path << '\n';            // folder\foo.barpath.remove_filename();cout << path << '\n';            // folder```

#### replace_extension()
We had seen that `ext()` includes a leading `.`. Consistently, when using [`replace_extension()`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/fs/path/replace_extension) make sure to include the `.` in the new string when you intend to keep the postfix as an extension.

```cpp
fs::path p = "foo/bar.text";cout << p << '\n';            // foo\bar.textp.replace_extension(".txt");cout << p << '\n';            // foo\bar.txt  ```

#### Iteration
When iterating over the elements of a path:

```cpp
for (auto e : path)    cout << '[' << e << ']';cout << '\n';
```
Remember the following sequence ([quoting](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/fs/path/begin)):

1. root-name (if any)
2. root-directory (if any)
3. sequence of file-names, **omitting** any directory separators
4. If there is a directory separator after the last file-name in the path, the last element before the end iterator is a fictitious *dot* file name.

So, `C:\folder\number\1\abc.123.txt` gives:
`[C:][\][folder][number][1][abc.123.txt]`.  
`C:\folder\number\1\abc.123.txt\` gives: 
`[C:][\][folder][number][1][abc.123.txt][.]`.
